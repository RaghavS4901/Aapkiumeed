   <h1 style="font-size:3.5Vw;color:red; text-align:center;">MUCORMYCOSIS:THE "BLACK FUNGUS"</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">The fungal disease, called mucormycosis, has a 50% mortality rate. It affects patients initially in the nose but the fungus can then spread into the brain, and can often only be treated by major surgery removing the eye or part of skull and jaw.<br><br>It is usually a rare disease, but more than 7,200 people in India have now been reported with mucormycosis and 219 have lost their lives. The rise in black fungus infections, mostly in patients who had severe cases of Covid-19, has been linked to an overuse of steroids in the treatment of the coronavirus, which can acutely compromise the immune system if taken over a prolonged period. The high incidence of diabetes in India has also been blamed, with high blood sugar levels linked to susceptibility. India has the second highest rate of diabetes in the world.<br><br> It has also been reported in Covid patients who were on ventilators in intensive care units, due to their airways being exposed to humidity and moisture.<br><br> The disease is caused by fungal spores found in soil and organic matter, usually inhaled by humans from the air. The mould enters the body and then manifests around the nose and eye sockets, causing the nose to blacken, and if not stopped will move fatally into the brain. Healthy individuals will usually fight off the fungus but it can spread fast in those with compromised immunity.<br><br> So far five states, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Telangana, have declared black fungus to be an epidemic, and more states are expected to follow. The Indian Council of Medical Research has issued an advisory on the diagnosis and treatment of the disease.<br><br> Maharashtra, the first state to be hit hard by India’s second Covid wave, has already reported upwards of 1,500 cases and 90 deaths, the highest in the country. Hospitals in Delhi have also begun reported an unprecedented rise in cases – as much 15 to 20 new cases a day in some hospitals, compared with previous rates of one or two cases a month. In Delhi and Bangalore, there are now waiting lists for beds for treatment for the disease. </p>
</div>
<div class="1001">
   <h2 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">Why is it occurring in COVID 19 patients?</h2>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Mucormycosis can occur any time after COVID-19 infection, either during the hospital stay or several days to a couple of weeks after discharge. <br><br> The COVID-19 causes favourable alteration in the internal milieu of the host for the fungus and the medical treatment given, unwittingly also abets fungal growth. COVID-19 damages the airway mucosa and blood vessels. It also causes an increase in the serum iron which is very important for the fungus to grow. Medications like steroids increase blood sugar. Broad-spectrum antibiotics not only wipe out the potentially pathogenic bacteria but also the protective commensals. Antifungals like Voriconazole inhibit Aspergillosis but Mucor remains unscathed and thrives due to lack of competition. Long-term ventilation reduces immunity and there are speculations of the fungus being transmitted by the humidifier water being given along with oxygen. All the above make for a perfect recipe for mucormycosis infection. </p>
</div>
<div class="1000001">
   <h3 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">What are the clinical features of mucormycosis infection? How do we diagnose them?</h3>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Nasal blockage, bleeding, discharge from the nose are initial features of mucormycosis. On endoscopic visualization of the nasal cavity an unmistakable black eschar (slough or dead tissue) coated masses will be present which gives away the diagnosis. As the disease progresses the palate may be destroyed as a large black necrotic mass may be seen on opening the mouth. When the orbit is involved there will be proptosis (protrusion of eyeball), loss of movements of the eyeball with consequent double vision. Eye pain, redness with blindness can follow. If the brain is invaded due to blood vessel blockage there will be strokes, hemorrhages, and even death. Patients can also have headaches, drowsiness, limb weakness, seizures and even death.<br><br> Based on clinical suspicion MRI and CT scan of the nasal cavity, sinuses, and brain is performed. These give a clear picture of the presence of the lesion along with its extent.<br><br> In lung mucormycosis clinical features are similar to COVID-19 with fever, cough, shortness of breath, making clinical diagnosis difficult. Suspicion of fungal infection must be considered when a patient despite getting appropriate medications is not improving or was improving and has unexplained deterioration. CT chest helps in diagnosis by revealing additional lung lesions. Diagnosis is by microscopic evaluation of the bronchopulmonary lavage aspirate. </p>
</div>
<div class="11">
   <h4 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">How is ROCM(Black Fungus) treated?</h4>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">It is a multi-pronged approach. Time is of the essence here. Once a clinical and radiological diagnosis is made, endoscopic evaluation of the nasal cavity can confirm a fungal lesion. Immediate surgical debulking is a must. The surgery can be radical and disfiguring but is acceptable considering the existential crisis of leaving behind any residual tissue. The entire nasal cavity needs to be scoured and all fungal, necrotic tissue needs to be removed. If the orbit is involved surgeries as drastic as exenteration of the eye socket contents may be required. Intracranial decompression may be required if the infection has spread to the brain. Surgical intervention should be undertaken a couple of hours after diagnosis.<br><br> In tandem, medical management with antifungal drugs, namely injection Liposomal amphotericin-B needs to be instituted. Older form amphotericin deoxycholate is significantly nephrotoxic. However, the liposomal cousin is safe and effective. Posaconazole tablets/ suspension and intravenous forms are available and are used in lieu of amphotericin if the latter is not tolerated by the patient. Following several weeks of intravenous medication depending on the response the patient is put on oral posaconazole sustained release tablets for several months. Isavuconazole is also an alternative drug that can be used. Drugs are stopped after clinical and radiological clearance of the disease.<br><br> During treatment, judicious use of steroids (keeping blood sugar levels under control), antibiotics, and other antifungal drugs need to be done. </p>
</div>
<div class="1010000000">
   <h5 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">How to prevent the occurrence of ROCM(Black Fungus)? </h5>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Prevention is always better than cure.<br> In hospital: <br> *Maintenance of good hygiene and cleanliness is a must. Regular oral hygiene care with mouthwash, povidone-iodine gargles must be done. <br> *While administering oxygen, water for humidification must be sterile and there should be no leakage from the humidifier. <br> *Steroid usage must be limited to no more than necessary with strict blood glucose control. <br> *Unnecessary use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals should not do as this removes the normal commensal flora resulting in the growth of unwanted organisms due to lack of competition. <br> Once discharged: <br> *Stay indoors as much as possible <br> *Regular exercises <br> *Control of blood sugars <br> *At home, the surroundings must be clean and free from dust and dampnes <br> *Maintain oral and nasal hygiene <br> *While going out always wear an N-95 mask <br> *Avoid construction areas, fields, grounds. <br> *Soil and plants are the areas that abound with fungi. Hence better to avoid working with soil, gardening. If unavoidable, masks, rubber gloves, and boots are a must. </p>
</div>
<div class="1009090901">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">White Fungus</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">According to experts, the white fungus infections are more dangerous than black fungus due to its acute affect on lungs and other body parts. White fungus becomes more lethal because of the way it spreads and causes great damage to the vital organs. It may impact brain, respiratory organs, digestive tract, kidneys, nailbed or even private parts</p>
</div>
<div class="1009078780901">
   <h2 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">WHO IS MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY WHITE FUNGUS? </h2>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">According to a report by <a href="https://indianexpress.com/">The Indian Express</a>, the white fungus is more likely to infect people with low immunity. It can also be caused if people come in contact with water or unsanitary environment containing the moulds. The disease isn’t contagious but a person is said to be vulnerable to the infection since these moulds can be easily inhaled by a patient. The fungus can further spread to vital organs and cause complications. <br><br> People with low immunity, commorbidities, diabetes, cancer or those using steroids regularly are at a higher risk. </p>
</div>
<div class="10089674747901">
   <h3 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF WHITE FUNGUS </h3>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Patients of white fungus infection show symptoms similar to COVID-19. The four white fungus cases reported in Patna hospital showed COVID-related symptoms but did not test positive for COVID. In all the cases, the lungs of the patients were found infected. The symptoms can also be similar to black fungus.<br> As the white fungus affects lungs and chest, it may lead to cough, chest pain, breathlessness. The infection may have inflammatory symptoms and cause swelling, infections, persistent headaches and pains <br> While the infection can be detected through X-rays and CT scans, the patients are given anti-fungal medication for its treatment. In the cases reported in Patna, the patients were given anti-fungal medicines and they recovered.  </p>
</div>
<div class="100987658900901">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">YELLOW FUNGUS</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">While black fungus infection has been declared as an epidemic in some states, yellow fungus infection isn't exactly new. Medically known as mucor septicus, doctors have said that the infection was not previously seen in humans but only in reptiles <br><br> A yellow fungus infection, much like other fungal infection spreads via contaminated environments, or when a suspected patient inhales moulds (mycometes) which grow in the environment. <br><br> What makes this infection different from white and black fungus infection is the manner of its spread. While black fungus starts off with distinct facial disfiguration, the yellow fungus infection starts to cause symptoms by launching an attack on the body's internal organ, and disturbing vital bodily processes. <br><br>  Since the damage caused by the infection is said to be much more dangerous and severe, experts now warn people to start recognizing the infection from day 01 and seek help </p>
</div>
<div class="1009090993548203541035">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">How does it spread? Is it contagious?</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Fungal infections spread when a person inhales moulds, and are found in the environment. Now, yellow fungus infections could also be spread via high levels of humidity or presence of old, contaminated food. However, poor hygiene and unsanitary conditions remain to be the prime reasons for infection. <br><br> While fungal infections can primarily attack people with compromised immunity, yellow fungus or other fungal infections being talked about right now aren't exactly contagious, since they cannot be spread from person to person like other respiratory infections, including that of COVID-19. The risk of external spread hasn't been found or studied in detail as of yet. </p>
</div>
<div class="10090907398279237284284237">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">What makes a person susceptible to the risks?</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">Depending on your health and risk factors, yellow fungus infections can strike as a primary or secondary infection. However, from what has been evidently seen so far, the risks continue to be aggravated for those people who have compromised immunity, frail health or suffering from pre-existing problems like uncontrolled diabetes, high cholesterol, which cause inflammation and reduce the body's ability to fight off infections. <br><br> As seen with COVID-recovered cases (or those in the middle of recovery), a rise in fungal infections has been reported amongst those put on prolonged oxygen support, or have been prescribed steroid use. The use of steroids have now come under scrutiny from leading medical authorities.<br><br> It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma. </p>
</div>
<div class="1009090973549253920998989898989898981">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5vw;color:red; text-align:center;">Symptoms of the infection</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">As per available case studies, following are the broad symptoms of yellow fungus infection:<br><br>*Disrupted digestion<br><br>*Slow metabolism,unexplained-unusual weight loss<br><br>*Pus leakage<br>*Loss of appetite, malnutrition<br><br> *Scrawny,sunken eyes<br><br>*Lack of energy, lethargy and fatigue<br><br> *Necrosis (in severe cases)<br><br>*Delayed healing of wounds<br><br>*Prolonging recovery timelines </p>
</div>
<div class="1207878787856565656560">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5Vw;color:red; text-align:center;">Why is it more dangerous than other fungal infections? </h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">From what has been seen right now, one of the reasons why a yellow fungus infection acts out differently to white fungus or black fungus is the way it spreads. Since it spreads internally, it can cause heavy internal damage and hence, more 'severe' in nature.For the same reason, people have been advised to seek treatment from the very beginning and prevent the case from becoming complicated in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="12787878765656554544343432320">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5Vw;color:red; text-align:center;">How can people protect themselves?</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">What we must remember is that we are only beginning to learn information about the new infection. However, like with any infection, one of the best steps to take is to safeguard your health.<br><br>Compromised immunity helps fungal infections thrive. People suffering from uncontrolled diabetes, or with a history of diabetes should be doubly careful of keeping their blood sugar levels under control.<br><br>As for patients battling COVID-19, since one reason for the spread of these hazardous moulds is unsanitary environments, one must ensure that proper disinfection is followed.<br><br>Those on oxygen therapy should also ensure that oxygen is well-filtered and not contaminated (such as with unclean water). Indiscriminate usage of steroids and related medications should be curtailed.<br><br>Additionally, doctors and specialists recommend that any at-risk patient not expose themselves to the risk unnecessarily, follow proper mask mandates, and maintain personal hygiene. Wearing clothes which do not expose the skin to probable contaminated surfaces may also go one step further to protect you.</p>
</div>
<div class="1289898987878787676767676767">
   <h1 style="font-size:3.5Vw;color:red; text-align:center;">TREATMENT OF YELLOW FUNGUS</h1>
   <p style= "color:white; font-size:3vw;">The treatment is same as that of black and white fungus giving Amphoteracin-B injection</p>
